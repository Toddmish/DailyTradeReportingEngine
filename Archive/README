The Archive folder contains an alternative implementation of InstructionReceiver
which when receiving a new instruction adjusts its settlement date and then creates
a new object of InstructionWithSettlDateAdjusted type which contains a reference to
already adjusted instructions. And it is exactly the object of InstructionWithSettlDateAdjusted type
which is added in the collection of received instructions.


Object of type StatisticsGenerator will operate only on InstructionWithSettlDateAdjusted type.
In this way is assured that statistics are generated on instructions with settlement date already
corrected.

Template method pattern is used to assure that method which adjusts settlement date is
called before method which adds instruction of type InstructionWithSettlDateAdjusted is called.
